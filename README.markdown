# Project I Shy

## Motivations
I come from a university which takes participation in class very seriously, class participation grades can weigh up to as much as 20% for a module/course. This makes it very disadvantages to students who are not used to speaking up. The aim of this project is to encourage students who are generally quiet in class to participate more.

## Initial idea
The name of every student will be listed. Anyone from the class can come in to peer evaluation (yes i know, this is very subjective, we will see how it goes) to give a score of 1, 2 or 3. This allows the rest of the class to keep track of how much each student has been participating real-time. I'm sure there are flaws to this system.
